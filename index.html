    <!--         
        A good place to start is with the title. Personalize the title of your
        page by changing the text within the <title></title> tags.
    -->
    <title>Photo Album</title>

    <!-- 
        Task 1 - Import and use a font from Google fonts.
        ************************************************************
        When you want to get really creative sometimes the standard fonts are not enough. Luckily you can choose many
        different fonts online and import them to use in your project. A great place to look is Google Fonts. https://www.google.com/fonts/
        When you find a font you like click the Quick-use button and follow the instuctions.
        
        We have selected a font below that we think works well. The first thing to do is import it into the site, you use the <link> tag to do that.

    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Indie+Flower" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
    <!-- 
        The CSS code below applies this font to the tags we want. We are selecting to add it to H2, H3 and H4 tags which are headings.
    -->
    <style>
        h1, h2, h3, h4 {
            /* The font-family style will apply our font 'Indie Flower' to the headings.*/
            font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive;
        }
    </style>

        We start with a header tag, this defines the content for the header of the page.

            <!-- 
                This is a <h1> Heading. We have created a simple logo by using CSS3 borders. You can change the CSS to create an alternate logo
                or you could try replacing the logo with an image.

                This is a <h2> Heading.  It is an important tag on the page but not as important as the main <h1>.
                The heading order goes from <h1> being the most important to <h6> being the least important.
                    
                Try changing the text to name your page.

                Photos are inside an unordered list (ul). 
                It behaves much like an ordered list but is more appropriate here because the order of the photos is unimportant.
                The images are placed inside individual list items (li).
                As the images are wrapped inside a link <a> tag they are clickable.  When clicked they will go to the address in the 'href' of the <a> tag.

                It's really easy to add some more photos to your gallery. Just copy the the <li></li> tags below (including the content inside) and paste under the last <li></li> tag.
                When you've done that make sure to change the link and image src. We've explained what you need to do below:
                
            -->
            <ul class="grid half-width group">
